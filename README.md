# MIPS-SoC

-Using Vivado Design Suite with the Artix-7 family of Xilinx FPGAs, designed and implemented a subset of the MIPS ISA.


-Utilized an SoC design for addressing devices external to the MIPS core functionality.


-Linked the SoC to a factorial accelerator and on-board SRAM for storage of results.
